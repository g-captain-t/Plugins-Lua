# G_Captain's Backdoor Scan
A scan I developed that checks server scripts through a vocabulary of popular backdoors. \
The plugin: https://www.roblox.com/library/5935478138

### Running a Scan

To use, simply open the plugin and click "Start Scan" to run the scan.

Make sure to check all the categories.\
If scripts were flagged, they will show up in the category's list. You can click on it to quarantine the script, which will be found in a folder in Workspace. You can decide to review the scripts or remove it.


### Categories / Warning Levels
The scan would divide flagged scripts into Red, Orange, and Yellow flags depending on where the detected threat is categorized.
- **Red**: Most likely exploits or backdoors.
- **Orange**: Common exploits may contain this. Check immediately if this script is from a trusted source or if the object it's in needs this code.
- **Yellow**: Simply a caution warning. Non-malicious and malicious code commonly use this.
